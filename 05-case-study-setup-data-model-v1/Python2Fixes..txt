1) Have to use python 2.

Hadd build issue on mac.

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems

had to use:

 CFLAGS="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include" pyenv install 2.7.15
 

2) Faker Issue:

ImportError: The ``fake-factory`` package is now called ``Faker``.

I had the same problem.

As the ImportError implies, you need to install Faker for this.

Move the directory in which your python library is installed and try this..

First uninstall fake-factory (I use pip) pip uninstall fake-factory

Then check if it is uninstalled using pip freeze and it should not be there

Then, proceed with installing Faker by pip install Faker

Now, try running that code again, it should work. Hope this helps :)

3) Added sleep in item gen because I was exceeding the throughput with batch write.
